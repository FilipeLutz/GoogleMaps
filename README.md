# Google Maps Mobile App

- **Mobile Apps II Assignment 7**

## Project Description

This project is an Android application designed to provide a customized map experience using the Google Maps API.  
The app allows users to view a map centered on a specific location, interact with markers, and dynamically change their attributes.  
The project highlights modern Android development practices, integrating tools like **Jetpack Compose** and **Kotlin Coroutines** for seamless user interaction and navigation.

### Key Features:

- **Marker Interactivity**: Displays a marker on a Google Map, with the ability to dynamically change its color using a button click.
- **Google Maps Integration**: Leverages the Google Maps API for an interactive and real-time geospatial visualization.
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Effortless navigation between screens, including a map screen and a back navigation button.
- **Modern UI Design**: Implements **Jetpack Compose** to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

### Screens:

- **Input Screen**: Users must input a latitude and longitude or an address to enable the button to proceed to the Map Screen.
- **Map Screen**: Displays a map centered on the entered location with a marker.
  - Users can dynamically change the color of the marker using a button.
  - Users can navigate back to the input screen using a back button.

### Key Functionalities:

1. **Input Handling**: Accepts latitude, longitude, or address input from the user.
2. **Map Display**: Shows a map centered at the user-provided location.
3. **Marker Placement**: Places a marker at the specified location on the map.
4. **Dynamic Marker Color Change**: Allows users to change the marker's color through a button click.
5. **Back Navigation**: Provides easy navigation to return to the input screen.
